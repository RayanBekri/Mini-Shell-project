# Custom Shell Project

This project is a custom implementation of a Unix-like shell. It is designed to parse and execute a variety of shell commands, support compound commands with operators like `&&`, `||`, and `|`, and handle input/output redirection.

## Features

- **Interactive Mode:** Run the shell in an interactive mode where commands can be entered one at a time.
- **Batch Mode:** Execute commands from a file, useful for scripting and automation.
- **Support for Compound Commands:** Handle compound commands using operators like `&&` (AND), `||` (OR), and `|` (PIPE).
- **I/O Redirection:** Redirect the output of commands to files using the `>` operator.
- **Command History:** In interactive mode, commands are saved to `history.txt`.
